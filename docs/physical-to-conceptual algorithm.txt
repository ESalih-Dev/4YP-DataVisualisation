Algorithm for physical => conceptual model:

1) All entries in themselves are basic entities
2) Pass through one-to-one relationships. These are already defined and can be removed from the data structure.
3) Now pass through all the one-to-many relationships:
	if the "many" side is a PK of that table:
		= We have one-to-many relationship
	else if the "many" side is a FK of that table:
		if the "one" side is a PK:
			if the table name of the "one" and "many" side is the same:
				= Reflexive/recursive relationship
			else if the "many" side has another FK related to another table's PK in a one-to-many relationship:
				= Many-to-many relationship (or possibly weak-entity with 2 owners)
			else:
				= Weak entity relationship			
		else:
			= Chained weak-entity relationship
